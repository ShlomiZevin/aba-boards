# Doing - Kids Task Board App

## What is this?

"Doing" is a task board app designed for children. It helps kids build good daily habits by completing tasks and earning rewards.

## Core Features

- **Task Board**: Kids have a visual board showing their daily tasks (like brushing teeth, doing homework, etc.)
- **Points & Rewards**: When kids complete tasks, they earn points. These points accumulate towards goals/rewards they want (like a toy, special activity, etc.)
- **Dino - The AI Friend**: A friendly dinosaur avatar that talks to kids, encourages them, knows their tasks and progress, and celebrates their achievements. Dino uses voice - kids speak to it and it responds with speech.
- **Testimonies**: Kids can record/write how they completed tasks, adding a personal touch and accountability.
- **Parent Management**: Parents set up the tasks, rewards, and can track their child's progress.

## The Goal

Make daily routines fun and rewarding for kids. Instead of nagging, parents set up tasks and rewards, and kids are motivated by Dino's encouragement and the reward system to complete their daily responsibilities independently.
